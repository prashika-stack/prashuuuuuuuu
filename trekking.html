    One of the famous treks of Nepal is the Annapurna Base Camp Trek. It starts and ends in Pokhara, the beloved tourist destination on the lakeside of Phewa Taal.
This trek takes you through the Himalayan landscape to majestic mountains like Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, Machhepuchhre, and Hiunchuli.
Annapurna Base Camp is a popular travel destination, which makes its trails mostly crowded during peak trekking seasons. Thus, it is unsuitable if you want an off-the-trail trekking adventure.

The ultimate gateway to the mysterious world of Lo, a once-forbidden Buddhist kingdom of Mustang, the Upper Mustang Trek offers a great exploration. It was opened to the outside world in 1992. Due to its isolation, it has preserved its ancient language and culture, which you can witness on your trek. 
The enchanting landscape of Mustang, with its rugged terrains and tanned red cliffs and hills, will give you a different perspective of Nepal altogether.
